- If you wish to develop templates for the same, please try naming them in the following format `statico-<name>-template`, to make it easier for people looking for other templates and make sure you have a demo/preview link for the same on the repo.

- The templates are purely built on go-templates and you can include and do all kinds of stuff that you'd do with a normal go template, the only limitation being that the config can take only so many 4 types of template name so those 4 are to act as your umbrella templates, you can always use the above example templates for checking out use-cases
