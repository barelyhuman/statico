# statico

Minimal Markdown Static Site Generator

# WIP

Currently works specifically to the [reaper.im](https://reaper.im) usecase and will me made more generic as
the project progresses.

# v0.0.1-dev.1

Adds a decent amount of dynamic generation for you to go ahead and try out statico for creating a simple blog. You can check out the [barelyhuman.dev](https://github.com/barelyhuman/barelyhuman.dev) repo to see an example in action.

The project is going to keep developing as and when I need changes if you'd like to help improve, raise issues you and PR's for the needed performance and code quality improvements.
