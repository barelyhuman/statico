## Motivation

I use markdown for most of my writing and really like the simplicity. This started as an experiment to power my websites but is now at a decent level of generalisation to be used by others.

## Features

- Supports Templates (Go Templates)
- Watch Mode
- âš¡ Fast
- Markdown => HTML

## Install

- You can download the binaries from the [releases](/releases) page for your specific system and add it to a directory that is in your `PATH` variables.

## Usage

```sh
$ statico [flags]

Usage of statico:
  -watch Run in watch mode
  -h show this list
```

The cli has just 2 functions,

1. To convert the given folder of markdown into html based on the given templates and has no default templates, you can use [barelyhuman.dev](https://github.com/barelyhuman.dev) as a base if you don't want to write your own templates.

2. To do the same as above but with a watcher, so it can monitor changes for you.

The tool needs a `config.yml` and you can find a template in this repository [`config.template.yml`](/config.template.yml)
